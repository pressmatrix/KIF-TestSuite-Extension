This ist just a temp repository so we see if people like our idea of KIF with test suites and propper setUp and tearDown steps that are not evaluated.

Note there are lot´s of weird hacks in this code like swizzeling methods at runtime. We will make it pretty once we´re sure how we submit it to https://github.com/square/KIF
